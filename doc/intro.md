Often we need to invoke the Scala compiler programmatically. The standard
invocation requires parameters to be specified as a sequence of strings,
exactly as they would be specified when invoking the `scalac` command from a
shell. This lacks any typesafety, and this flaw is what _Anthology_ aims to
correct.
